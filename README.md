# Anchore Troubleshooting Guide

This guide will walkthrough some general troubleshooting tips with your Anchore Engine instance. Anchore Engine is built and delivered as a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/anchore/anchore-engine). The Anchore Engine is a collection of services that can be deployed co-located or fulkly distributed or anythin in-between, as such it can scale out to increase analysis throughput. The only external system required is PostgreSQL (9.6+) that all services connect to, but do not use for communication beyond some very simple service registration / lookup processes. 

## Anchore CLI

The Anchore CLI provides a command line interface on top of the Anchore Engine installation. Anchore CLI is published as a Python package that can be installed from source from the Python PyPi package repository on any platform supporting PyPi. For more information on installing the CLI, check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/anchore/anchore-cli). There is also a Anchore Engine CLI container image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/anchore/engine-cli/). Finally, the Anchore CLI comes packaged inside the Anchore Engine container, and can be accessed by executing into the running Anchore Engine container. 

### Troubleshooting the CLI

By default the Anchore CLI will try to connect to the Anchore Engine at `http://localhost:8228/v1` with no authentication. The username, password and URL for the server can be passed to the Anchore CLI as command line arguments. 

```
--u   TEXT   Username     eg. admin (default)
--p   TEXT   Password     eg. foobar (default)
--url TEXT   Service URL  eg. http://localhost:8228/v1
```

Rather than passing these parameters for every call to the cli they can be stores as environment variables.

```
ANCHORE_CLI_URL=http://myserver.example.com:8228/v1
ANCHORE_CLI_USER=admin
ANCHORE_CLI_PASS=foobar
```

If you run into an `"Unauthorized"` error, verify you have configured the Anchore CLI appropriately, as this error is most commonly seen when the Username, Password, or Service URL are improperly set. 

**Note:** When passing the parameters through the command line, order matters. For example, `anchore-cli --url http://localhost:8228/v1 --u admin --p foobar system status`
